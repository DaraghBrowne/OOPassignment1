This is my submission for the OOP assignment due 29/11/2016.
When started a loading screen displays. This features a neat looking set of circles with a smaller circle orbitting around the outermost circle. As this takes place a loading bar transverses across the bottom of the screen. Once this bar hits the edge of the window, the text changes from "LOADING" to "PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE". With this prompt the user presses a key and continues to the main screen.
At this point the user has made it to the main screen! the main feature of this screen is the rotating arcs in the center. This is an array of arcs evenly dispersed which are roatating at different speeds to give off a cool animation.
The top of the screen displays the system status and the current time.
The left of the screen displays a simple animation drawing a barchart.
The right of the screen two rotating star like objects. the color of the center star depends on the mapped X and Y positions of the cursor on the screen.
The bottom of the screen displays a moving sine graph. When the cursor is kept on the bottom bar on the screen, the interface goes to danger mode. Multiple graphs appear and danger colours are seen throughout.
